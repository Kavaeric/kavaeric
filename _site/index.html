            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I'm Shoji Ushiyama, but I mostly go by my online alias, <strong>Kavaeric</strong>. I'm a 20-year-old Japanese artist from Hong Kong.</p>
            <p>My main personal worldbuilding project is +700, a science fiction world set 700 years in the future. I take interest in drawing fashion, firearms and guns, cars, spaceships, graphic design, space, among other things.</p>
            <p>Art aside, I can do some programming work, do front-end web development, and have an interest in computers in general. I also have interests in music composition and 3D modelling, but would still like much improvement those areas.</p>
            <p>I am currently attending Centennial College in Toronto for an advanced diploma in Product Design and Development.</p>
